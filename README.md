# 1. Introduction to On-chip clock multiplier
This repository contains simulation files and other relevant files on the On-chip clock multiplier using PLL (Fclkin—5MHz to 12MHz, Fclkout—40MHZ to 100MHZ at 1.8v) IP worked on in the VSD Online Internship-Batch 3.

The target is to design a On-chip clock multiplier using the Sky130 technology node which is an open source PDK provided by Google. The specifications are provided from VSD Corporation Pvt. Ltd. The On-chip clock multiplier is present in almost all synchronous processor chips.
